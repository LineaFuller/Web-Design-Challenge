# Web-Design-Challenge

Data is more powerful when people share it with others! Using HTML and CSS I created a dashboard showing off the data visualizations and analysis of what I have done thus far.

# Background
In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which the user can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is also a landing page, a page with comparisons of all of the plots, and another page with the data used to build them.
